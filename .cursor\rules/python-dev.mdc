# Python Development Rules

## Code Quality
- DRY principle, composition over inheritance, pure functions when possible
- Simple solutions over clever ones, design for common use cases first
- Type hints required, snake_case naming, Google-style docstrings
- Keep functions small (single responsibility), preserve existing comments

## Error Handling & Efficiency  
- Specific exception types, validate inputs early, no bare except
- f-strings, comprehensions, context managers

## Testing (Critical)
- **pytest only** (no unittest), all tests in `./tests/` with `__init__.py`
- TDD approach: write/update tests for all new/modified code
- All tests must pass before task completion

## Environment
- Dependency management via https://github.com/astral-sh/uv and virtual environments.
- Code style consistency using Ruff.
- **Virtual Environment or uv**: Always use either `uv` or a virtual environment (`venv`) when running Python scripts. Check for an existing `.venv` in the current or parent directories before creating a new one. Activate the `.venv` before installing packages or executing scripts.
